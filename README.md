# etch-a-sketch-12-06

This is a challenge found in The Odin Project regarding "Project: Etch-a-Sketch".

The idea of the project is to build a container that contains a series of divs, where each can be interacted width by pointing your mouse over them. When you do, each interacted square changes its colors.

The user can also decide the number of squares per line, from a minimum of 2 to a maximum of 100

The only thing that wasn't done was the additional challenge where each interaction with the squares darkens them by 10%, until they get completly black after 10 mouseovers.
